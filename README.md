This is an android app that can translate and ANT+ signal to BLE signal for use in BLE only device like zwift on Applt TV ot iPad.

I have build this app by modifying the code from below source:
ANT-Android-SDKs: https://github.com/ant-wireless/ANT-Android-SDKs/blob/master/ANT+_Android_SDK/README.md
ANT STARTING YOUR PROJECT: https://www.thisisant.com/developer/ant/starting-your-project/#75_tab
WebBluetoothCG/ble-test-peripheral-android: https://github.com/WebBluetoothCG/ble-test-peripheral-android

I am new to programing, maybe there is some obvious bug in this app, please help advise if u can make it a better app.

Also, please feel free to contact me if i have violate the usage of any source code in this app.
